## Goal
In recent times, the narrative of summer in the western United States has been increasingly dominated by wildfires, with plumes of smoke enveloping multiple states. Several factors are implicated in this development, including climate change, forestry management policies of the United States, and a heightened collective consciousness of such events. Irrespective of their origins, the consequences of these fires extend far and wide, affecting numerous facets of life. Studies are consistently highlighting the adverse effects of smoke on human health, tourism, property values, and the socioeconomic fabric at large.

The primary aim of this initiative is to scrutinize the repercussions of wildfire smoke on Farmington, New Mexico, with the objective of deriving actionable insights to guide diverse interested parties. Our preliminary step involves an examination of historical wildfire data to derive estimates of smoke penetration within the city's confines. Subsequently, leveraging these findings, we aim to forecast the likely smoke patterns for the forthcoming quarter-century.
